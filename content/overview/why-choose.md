You have been storing your measurement data for a long time in different, more or less proprietary and department specific data storage solutions. Now you find that you’re in one of the following situations:

**You are no longer able to assign your measurement data, you can’t find them now, or you don’t know where to look for them.**  
Using openMDM® you can document your measurement data in your own terminology. You can ascribe descriptors, standardize terms and classify information. openMDM® automatically adapts to navigation and searches.

**You want to compare measurement results which were generated with different tools (test equipment, software) or under different conditions**  
openMDM® guarantees comparability by using standardised and professionally described data storage. openMDM® processes descriptive content in the data and is thereby able to support the selection of comparison criteria, or reduce compatibility problems.

**You want to evaluate your measurement data with a new method which is available from another manufacturer**  
openMDM® offers universal and stable standardisation and an interface concept that is open and independent of manufacturer.

**You want to transmit measurement data to a colleague or perhaps a partner organisation for further processing.**  
openMDM® supports the storage and transmission of complete and fully specified information. Conversion problems do not arise and data are not lost.

**You want to reduce specific parts of your database.**  
The openMDM® mechanics for classifying, segregating by type and describing information can also be used to manage life cycle processes.

**You have to demonstrate adherence to guidelines (such as product liability, diligence, security or data protection).**  
openMDM® is able to control typical activities in the data life cycle (issuing and withdrawal of access rights, deletion, archiving). Data processing steps can be documented. By linking into company-wide authentication procedures, personal access right at the server level can be guaranteed. If necessary, additional encryption procedures can be configured.

**Your team has planned various tests and you want to be kept informed on how the work is progressing.**  
openMDM® will provide continuous updates to give a clear overview at any given time, including the possibility of specifying workflows.

**You have planned a test and specified all boundary conditions, but in performing the test you can comply with only some of these conditions.**  
Since openMDM® is able to keep a record of the planning of a test separate from its execution, you can reassess the relevance of test results with the benefit of hindsight.

**You want to distribute your measurement data between different sites without significant losses in performance**  
openMDM® is based on the secure, central management of databases in a central physical storage facility. Databases can be stored in the background.
