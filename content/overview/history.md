In 1999 openMDM® originated as an idea for a reusable systems building block in multi-year planning and implementation projects for measurement data management systems in the Technical Development Department of AUDI AG.

From 2008 openMDM® was published by Audi as open source. From then on large vehicle manufacturers and suppliers such as Bosch, BMW, DAF, Daimler and FEV joined the open MDM community as active users and started in collaboration with different tool vendors and service provides their own openMDM® projects.

Since 2014 the establishment of the openMDM® Eclipse Working Group created a new organizational framework which makes it possible to push improvements and the international distribution of openMDM® more intensively.
